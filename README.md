# project1-ccovarrubias1
https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/ccovarrubias1-project1/deploy/github


For someone to run this app they need to install spotipy and get their own credientals to use the APIs

First problem I would like to address is that I could not use the Genius API because it could not find how to retrieve the information. If I had more time I would learn more about the Genius API and APIs in general
Second Problem I would like to address is that I could not get random generated songs from artist but instead I used the top track of the artist. If I had more time I would try selecting randomly from the top tracks of the artist

First Technical Issue I had was that my VM crashed multiple times but I didn't lose my code because I would Push it to github often
Second Technical Issue was that I could not load my code onto heroku until I searched and learned how to change the default push to main instead of master
